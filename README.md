# coffee-machine project

* The machine lets you choose a drink.
* It checks if it has enough resources to make the drink for you.
* It then let you insert coins.
* It checks if the coins are worth the drink and proceed to make the drink for you if so.
* It then gives you the drink and returns your balance.
* It updates its amount of available resources each time it makes a drink.
* It also keeps a record of money it has made so far.
* It can be turned of by entering 'off' at the point where it asks you to choose a drink.
